# Schrödinger Equation Solving
We present scripts for solving the N-dimensional (N = 1, 2, 3) Schrödinger equation that were used in the project of M.V. Kaplanskiy et al., Deconstructing 1H NMR Chemical Shifts in Strong Hydrogen Bonds: A Computational Investigation of Solvation, Dynamics, and Nuclear Delocalization Effects, J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2025, 65, 10, 5019–5034 (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00566). 

All algorithms are based on unpublished scripts by Wai Kooi Wong: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357203546_Solving_3D_Time_Independent_Schrodinger_Equation_Using_Numerical_Method
